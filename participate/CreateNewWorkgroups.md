<h2>Proposing a new technical Workgroup</h2>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Create a draft Workgroup Charter &ndash; see the <a href="/workgroups/core/#workgroup-charter">existing</a> <a href="http://open-services.net/workgroups/automation/#workgroup-charter">charters</a> <a href="http://open-services.net/workgroups/change-management/#workgroup-charter">for</a> <a href="http://open-services.net/workgroups/performance-monitoring/#workgroup-charter">some</a> <a href="http://open-services.net/workgroups/architecture-management/#workgroup-charter">ideas</a> &ndash; that includes (to start):</p>

	<ul>
		<li>A brief description of the topic/domain area;</li>
		<li>The nature of the integrations of interest, the value of the integrations and the motivation for forming the Workgroup;</li>
		<li>A proposed Workgroup leader and a list of interested or targeted individuals or organizations (4-5 members recommended);</li>
		<li>The technical scope of specifications that the Workgroup will develop</li>
		<li>A proposed Target standards development organization (SDO), if any.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Consider existing Workgroup efforts and industry specifications or standards to avoid introducing overlap or conflict.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Share the draft charter with the OSLC community (via the <a href="http://open-services.net//mailman/listinfo/community_open-services.net">mailing list at community@open-services.net</a>). Discussions and refinement of the draft Charter will typically follow.</li>
	<li>Submit the draft charter <a href="http://open-services.net//mailman/listinfo/oslc-steeringcommittee_open-services.net">to the Steering Committee for consideration</a>. They will focus on the value and relevance of the proposed topic area, consistency with the OSLC architecture and guiding principles, and relationship to other active Workgroups.</li>
	<li>The Steering Committee will work with the founders of the prospective Workgroup to refine a final draft of the Workgroup Charter, including determining the target SDO of the Workgroup.</li>
	<li>The Steering Committee approves the Workgroup Charter and the site worker bees will start setting up the appropriate infrastructure (wikis, mailing lists, legal documents, etc.).</li>
</ol>

<h2>Proposing a new User Group</h2>

<p>Although it is a looser process than for our technical Workgroups, the Steering Committee must approve all new User Groups. Send an email <a href="http://open-services.net//mailman/listinfo/oslc-steeringcommittee_open-services.net">to the Steering Committee mailing list</a> with the following information:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Proposed name of the User Group</li>
	<li>Purpose and scope for the group. (Explore the charters of <a href="/workgroups/">our technical Workgroups</a> for some ideas.)</li>
	<li>Founding members (minimum of three organizations)</li>
	<li>Proposed initial group lead</li>
	<li>Any liaison relationships? (For example, any EU projects)</li>
	<li>A clear statement that the group will not be creating any patentable materials.</li>
	<li>(<i>optional</i>) Examples of potential user stories, use cases, or scenarios that you want the group to discuss</li>
	<li>(<i>optional</i>) OSLC specifications that may be related</li>
	<li>(<i>optional</i>) Upcoming events of interest to the group</li>
	<li>(<i>optional</i>) Proposed meeting frequency</li>
	<li>(<i>optional</i>) Why the Steering Committee should accept your proposal.</li>
</ol>

<p>Make a pitch and get the conversation started.</p>
