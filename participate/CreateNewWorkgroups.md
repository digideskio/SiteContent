Proposing a new technical Workgroup

Create a draft Workgroup Charter – see the existing charters for some ideas – that includes (to start):

A brief description of the topic/domain area;
The nature of the integrations of interest, the value of the integrations and the motivation for forming the Workgroup;
A proposed Workgroup leader and a list of interested or targeted individuals or organizations (4-5 members recommended);
The technical scope of specifications that the Workgroup will develop
A proposed Target standards development organization (SDO), if any.
Consider existing Workgroup efforts and industry specifications or standards to avoid introducing overlap or conflict.

Share the draft charter with the OSLC community (via the mailing list at community@open-services.net). Discussions and refinement of the draft Charter will typically follow.
Submit the draft charter to the Steering Committee for consideration. They will focus on the value and relevance of the proposed topic area, consistency with the OSLC architecture and guiding principles, and relationship to other active Workgroups.
The Steering Committee will work with the founders of the prospective Workgroup to refine a final draft of the Workgroup Charter, including determining the target SDO of the Workgroup.
The Steering Committee approves the Workgroup Charter and the site worker bees will start setting up the appropriate infrastructure (wikis, mailing lists, legal documents, etc.).
Proposing a new User Group

Although it is a looser process than for our technical Workgroups, the Steering Committee must approve all new User Groups. Send an email to the Steering Committee mailing list with the following information:

Proposed name of the User Group
Purpose and scope for the group. (Explore the charters of our technical Workgroups for some ideas.)
Founding members (minimum of three organizations)
Proposed initial group lead
Any liaison relationships? (For example, any EU projects)
A clear statement that the group will not be creating any patentable materials.
(optional) Examples of potential user stories, use cases, or scenarios that you want the group to discuss
(optional) OSLC specifications that may be related
(optional) Upcoming events of interest to the group
(optional) Proposed meeting frequency
(optional) Why the Steering Committee should accept your proposal.
Make a pitch and get the conversation started.
