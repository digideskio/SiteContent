# SiteContent
change management for the site content. Deployment is done on Express Engine 

The open-services.net site is setup for updates, not reviews. 
The intent is not to duplicate all pages here. However, this repository can be used to identify and work through pages that need updates. 

If you want in on this fun work, please contact Ginny Ghezzo (twitter, linkedIn) or webmaster at open-services dot net
