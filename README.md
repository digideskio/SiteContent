# SiteContent for Open-services.net 
This section of git is intended to provide a light weight change management for the site content. Once changes are agreed to, deployment is done through Express Engine (EE) and live. 

The intent is not to duplicate all pages here. 
1. Issues should be opened on this repository when a site pages needs to be updates. Please provide specific page link and details on the text to update. When final text is not known, please provide details on the intent. (Example: Update the site : http://open-services.net/workgroups/ from "This page lists companies and organizations that" to "This page lists companies and organizations that: " 
2. Alternately, contributions can be made through a pull request that either update a page already represented in this git repository or the content of the new page. Please start with the original text and then submit changes. 
3. The original purpose is to get the content correct. Formatting and graphics are not the original intent.
